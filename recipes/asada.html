        Carne Asada is an amazing way to prepare steak. Not only it is fantastic by itself you can also use it in many other dishes such as tacos, enchiladas, and more.
        The marinade of the steak is perfect as many of the ingredients serve as tenderizing agents and bring out the best flavor of the cut of steak.
