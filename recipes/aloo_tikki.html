        <p>
            Aloo Tikkis have been a staple in my house. Coming from Sindhi family we love potatoes
            and the aloo tikki serves as the perfect way to consume them. A spicy potato patty is fried
            to perfection and can be accompanied with a sauce or be the accompanyment to any dish to bring
            the eating experience to a whole new level.

        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. red potatoes</li>
            <li>2 green thai chilli</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
            <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>1/2 red onion</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. ground turmeric</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. rice flour</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut potatoes in half and place in large pot of water.
                Bring to boil over high heat and allow potatoes to boil
                until a knife easily pierces all the way through (15-30 minutes).
                Drain once done.
            </li>
            <li>
                Coarsely chop onions, chilli, and garlic clove.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once potatoes are cool enough to handle mash them, and
                combine all ingredients in one bowl and mix throughly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Form mixture into 2-3 inch patties, and shallow fry
                in an oil of your choice until golden brown. Then let rest
                on a paper-towel lined wire rack.
            </li>
        </ol>
